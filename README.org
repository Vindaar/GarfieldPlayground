* Simulation of events for Timepix based gaseous detectors

This is a Nim conversion of a C++ script written by [[https://github.com/magruber][@magruber]], which I
mostly wrote to play around with Garfield++ from Nim.

It requires a custom version of [[https://degrad.web.cern.ch/degrad/][Degrad]] that must be compiled and
placed next to the binary of ~abs_diffusion_amp~.

A bunch of CLI options to customize the gas, its temperature and
pressure etc. are available:
